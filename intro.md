xmake is a lightweight cross-platform build system based on Lua.

It is very friendly to novices and can quickly get started in a short time.

It can compile the project directly like Make/Ninja/Scons,
or generate project files like CMake/Meson.

Has a built-in package management system to help users solve the
integrated use of C/C++ dependent libraries.

Features a built-in cross-platform local cache solution, and provides remote
caching services, similar to Mozilla's sscache.

**Xmake = Build Backend + Project Generator + Package Manager + Build Cache**
